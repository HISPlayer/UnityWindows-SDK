# HISPlayer API

## Public API
The following public APIs are provided by HISPlayerManager.

* **public List < StreamProperties > multiStreamProperties**: List of properties for multi stream. However, currently HISPlayer iOS SDK only supports single stream.

## Functions
The following functions are provided by **HISPlayerManager**. They are **not public** so it’s necessary to create a custom script which inherits from **HISPlayerManager**.

### Virtual functions
These functions can be overridden.
#### protected virtual void Awake()
MonoBehaviour function which will be called from the beginning of the scene. It can be overridden but to make the system work it’s necessary to call base.Awake() into the overridden function.

#### protected virtual void EventPlaybackReady(HISPlayerEventInfo eventInfo)
Override this method to add custom logic when **HISPlayerEvent.HISPlayer_EVENT_PLAYBACK_READY** is triggered.
This event occurs when the current playback of a stream is ready to be used.
Calling functions such as GetTracks before this event is triggered will provide null information.
 
#### protected virtual void EventVideoSizeChange(HisPlayerEventInfo eventInfo)
Override this method to add custom logic when **HisPlayerEvent.HISPLAYER_EVENT_VIDEO_SIZE_CHANGE** is triggered.
This event occurs whenever the internal video size of the current track changes.
This event is triggered by the ABR feature.

 <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>

  <tr>
    <td>param1</td>
    <td>Value of the new track position in milliseconds.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### protected virtual void EventVolumeChange(HisPlayerEventInfo eventInfo)
Override this method to add custom logic when **HisPlayerEvent.HISPLAYER_EVENT_VOLUME_CHANGE** is triggered.
This event occurs whenever the volume has been modified.
 <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>caption</td>
    <td>The next generated caption text.</td>

### Non-virtual functions 
These functions can’t be overridden and they can be used only inside the inherited script. If it’s needed to use some of these functions into the Unity scene, for example with buttons, it is needed to create a public function which connects the button with the API.
