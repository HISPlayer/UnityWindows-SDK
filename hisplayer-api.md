## Functions
The following functions are provided by **HISPlayerManager**. They are **not public** so it’s necessary to create a custom script which inherits from **HISPlayerManager**.

### Virtual functions - These functions can be overridden

#### protected virtual void Awake()
MonoBehaviour function which will be called from the beginning of the scene. It can be overridden but to make the system work it’s necessary to call **base.Awake()** into the overridden function.

### Non-virtual functions 
These functions can’t be overridden and they can be used only inside the inherited script. If it’s needed to use some of these functions into the Unity scene, for example with buttons, it is needed to create a public function which connects the button with the API.

#### protected void SetUpPlayer()

Free all resources internally. When using different scenes, it's necessary to call this function before changing the scene. 
 
#### protected void Play(int playerIndex)
Play a certain stream giving a **playerIndex**. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.
 
#### protected void Pause(int playerIndex)
Pause a certain stream giving a **playerIndex**. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.
 
#### protected void Stop(int playerIndex)
Stop a certain stream giving a **playerIndex**. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.
 
#### protected void Seek(int playerIndex, long milliseconds)
Seek a certain stream to a certain time giving a **playerIndex** and the time of the track to be sought in **milliseconds**. The stream is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.
 
#### protected void SetVolume(int playerIndex, float volume)
Modify the volume of a certain stream giving a **playerIndex**. The **volume** of the track value ranges between 0.0f and 1.0f. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.

#### protected void AddStream(StreamProperties newStream)
Add a new stream to the list multiStreamProperties. The stream must be added using this function instead of changing the list manually.

#### protected void AddVideoContent(int playerIndex, string url)
Add new content to a certain player. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list. The **url** is the link to the new video. Please, make sure the string is correct. This function supports local file paths.
 
#### protected void ChangeVideoContent(int playerIndex, int urlIndex)
Change the video’s URL  of a certain player. The next playback will start paused if **autoPlay** is disabled. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list. The **urlIndex** is associated with the index of the element in the list of URLs.

#### protected void ChangeVideoContent(int playerIndex, string url)
Change the video’s URL of a certain player given a new URL. The next playback will start paused if **autoPlay** is disabled. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list. The parameter **url** is the link to the new video.

Remove a certain player. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.

All streams with a player indexes that are higher than the removed stream's player index will automatically reduce their index by 1, to avoid leaving intermediate player indexes without reference to a stream.

For example: Given an ordered list of initialized streams **[A(0), B(1), C(2), D(3), E(4)]**, when deleting stream **C** (**index 2**) , stream **D** will take **index 2** and stream **E** will take **index 3** instead of **4**, resulting in an ordered list of streams such as **[A(0), B(1), D(2), E(3)]**.
