# QuickStart Guide
Getting started with HISPlayer consists of implementing the following steps:

1. Import and configure package   

      1.1. Import package
 
      1.2. Configure Unity for Windows
   
2. Create your own sample
   
    2.1 Setup HISPlayer Manager
   
    2.2 Attach Unity Resources
   
    2.3 Configure HISPlayer Properties

    2.4 Build and Run

It's also possible to import the [HISPlayer Sample](https://hisplayer.github.io/UnitySamples/#/hisplayer-sample) after completing step 1. The sample is a comprehensive example scene using the HISPlayerSDK to help demonstrate features like play, pause, seek, etc.

## 1.1 Import package

### HISPlayer SDK versions 3.4.0 and above

The _HISPlayer Sample_ is included in the _HISPlayer SDK Unity Package_.

Importing the package is the same as importing other normal packages in Unity. 
Select the package of _HISPlayer SDK_ and import it.

**Assets > Import Package > Custom Package > HISPlayerSDK unity package**

Refer to [Import HISPlayer Sample](https://hisplayer.github.io/UnitySamples/#/hisplayer-sample) to know more about the HISPlayer Sample.

</p>

In the case you don't want to include the HISPlayer Sample, please disable it from the _Import Unity Package_ window.

</p>

### HISPlayer SDK versions 3.3.0 and below

Importing the package is the same as importing other normal packages in Unity. 
Select the package of HISPlayer SDK and import it.

**Assets > Import Package > Custom Package > HISPlayerSDK unity package**

Only the SDK will be imported using HISPlayer SDK versions lower than 3.4.0. 
Refer to [Import HISPlayer Sample](https://hisplayer.github.io/UnitySamples/#/hisplayer-sample) to know more about the _HISPlayer Sample_.

</p>

### <ins>Universal Windows Platform (UWP) Settings</ins>
Open the window **Tools > HISPlayer** located in the upper side of the screen > Click on Player Settings Configuration > Select **Build Target to UWP** > Set all the required settings.

## 2.1 Setup HISPlayer Manager
*You may skip this section if you are using [**HISPlayerSample**](./import-sample.md). The code set-up is already included in the sample script (HISPlayerSample.cs).*

Create a script which is going to inherit from **HISPlayerManager**. It is needed to include the namespace by adding **‘using HISPlayerAPI;’** and add this component to a GameObject. It is recommended to create an **Empty GameObject** for this.

Call the **‘SetUpPlayer()’** function in order to initialize the stream environment internally. This function can be called whenever it’s needed.

For example, using the Awake function:
```C#
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using HisPlayerAPI;

public class HISPlayerWindowsSample : HisPlayerManager
{
    protected override void Awake()
    {
        base.Awake();
        SetUpPlayer();
    }
}
```
It is strictly necessary to use **SetUpPlayer** before using anything else, because this function will initialize everything from the SDK in order to be able to use the rest of the functions (Play, Pause, Seek …).

## 2.2 Attach Unity Resources
Move to **Unity Editor** to attach all the resources. The rendering system is supporting **Material, RawImage, RenderTexture** and **NONE** (empty)  Unity’s components.

### <ins>Material</ins>
Create a new Material from **Assets > Create > Material** and attach it to the GameObject that is going to be used as screen and to the stream controller component. 

You can also use the **Resources > Materials > HISPlayerDefaultMaterial.mat** we provide in our package. 

<p align="center">

</p>

### <ins>Raw Image</ins>
This action will be related to Unity’s Canvas. If there is not a Canvas created yet, creating a **Raw Image** will create one automatically.

For the creation, select **GameObject > UI > Raw Image**. Once it is created, attach it to the stream controller component

<p align="center">
<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/HISPlayer/UnityWebGL-SDK/assets/47497948/5dcc7a3f-7de5-4e87-a5e3-3e08587360b4">
</p>

### <ins>RenderTexture</ins>
For this you can use the RenderTexture we provide or create a RenderTexture from zero. In the first case, go to the Resources folder of our package and attach the **Resources > Materials > HISPlayerDefaultMaterialRenderTexture.mat** to the GameObject that is going to be used as screen and the **Resources > RenderTextures > HISPlayerRenderTexture.renderTexture** to the stream controller component.

For creating it from zero, select **Assets > Create > Render Texutre** and then create a **Material** referencing the **Render Texture**. This last action can be done automatically by grabbing the **Render Texture** and dropping it at the end of a GameObject's Inspector with the component **Mesh Renderer** with **Material field empty**. This will create the new material inside a **Materials** folder. 

Once all this process it’s done, associate the **RenderTexture** to the script component.

</p>

## 2.3 Configure HISPlayer Properties

### <ins>License Key</ins>
If you received a license key from HISPlayer, please input the license key in the **License Key** field. 

<p align="center">
<img width="400" src="./assets/license-key-windows.PNG">
</p>

If the license key is not valid, the player won't work and will throw an error message. License key is not required for Unity Editor usage.

### <ins>Multi Stream Properties</ins>

Use **Multi Stream Properties** to set all configurations needed for multi stream. It starts with 0 elements. Each element added has its own configuration.
Each element added has its own configuration for multiple players and corresponds to 1 Render Surface. If you just need a single stream, then you just need to add 1 element with 1 URL.

* <span style="color:blue">**Render Mode**</span>: Select the render surface. It can be RenderTexture, Material, RawImage or NONE.
* <span style="color:blue">**Material**</span>: Attach the **Material** asset created to the **Material** section of the element.
* <span style="color:blue">**Raw Image**</span>: Attach the **RawImage** asset created to the **RawImage** section of the element.
* <span style="color:blue">**Render Texture**</span>: Attach the **RenderTexture** to the **RenderTexture** section of the element.
* <span style="color:blue">**URL**</span>: Add the URL associated to the stream. Each stream can have multiple URLs, therefore users can use the same render surface to play different URLs. It is also possible to add local files allocated in the device’s storage and the StreamingAssets special folder of Unity (see [Playing Local Files](/local-files.md) for more details).
* <span style="color:blue">**URL MIME Types**</span>: Set the MIME types of each URL. Setting this property will not take any effect for Windows. URL Extension is set by default.
* <span style="color:blue">**Autoplay**</span>: Property to determine whether the player will start automatically after set up.
* <span style="color:blue">**Loop Playback**</span>: Property to loop the current playback. It’s true by default.
* <span style="color:blue">**Auto Transition**</span>: Property to change the playback to the next video in the playlist. This action won’t have effect when loopPlayback is true. It’s false by default.
